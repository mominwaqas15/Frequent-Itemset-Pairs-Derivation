# Itemset Pairs Visualization

Boosting Business Brilliance: Unveiling Top-Selling Item Pairs in Grocery Stores!

In the bustling world of grocery retail, understanding customer preferences is key to success. My project dives deep into transactional data to uncover the dynamic duo of grocery items that fly off the shelves together. By identifying these top-selling pairs, grocery store owners can optimize their product placements, promotions, and inventory management strategies. With these insights, businesses can supercharge their sales and create a shopping experience that delights customers.

## Overview

The code in this repository allows you to create a network graph visualization of itemset pairs. The graph represents relationships between items, where each edge connects two items from the itemset pairs. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12
- pandas
- matplotlib
- networkx

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

`pip install pandas matplotlib networkx`


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/mominwaqas15/Frequent-Itemset-Pairs-Derivation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Frequent-Itemset-Pairs-Derivation

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to generate the itemset pairs graph:

`code.ipynb`

4. View the generated graph displayed in a new window.

## Configuration

You can customize the visualization by adjusting the node and edge properties in the Python script. For example, you can change the node color, size, font, and edge color.
